## Geometric Step Sequencer/Synthesizer - Capstone Project 

check it out: https://stollersystem.github.io/step_seq_UI_proto2/

### Description:
A website that displays various geometric shapes and includes controls to create and manipulate sound. At its core it will be a recreation of a late 70â€™s era step sequencer and synthesizer which combined together they create a platform to generate dreamy, minimal electronic music. 

### Use Case:
The user will be presented with a stylized page with one or more geometrical shapes and various controls (buttons, sliders) but without much text or direct direction as to what each control does. The main idea is to encourage the user to experiment and play around as they create sounds and rhythms! The SVG geometric shapes will then animate and react to the sounds.  

### Minimum Viable Product:
A built out step sequencer where you can turn steps on/off and control the pitch (note) of each step.
A full synthesizer that is triggered by the sequencer. 
Controls to manipulate the synthesizer with a filter, envelope, distortion and delay. 
A geometric visual control interface for the sequencer.
As the sequencer runs it will animate geometric shapes. 

### Tools for MVP:
Visual Studio Code
Node.js
React
JavaScript
Web Audio API
Tone.js
SVG
Inkscape

### Additional Features:
Ability to create a profile and log in
Hosted with a database so users can save their scenes. 
Mobile Support 
Change sequencer direction
Toggle between different sequences 
Once you create a scene (song) you can save your settings and name it and recall it later. 
Add more controls to manipulate sounds.
Add more options to each step in the sequencer, such as gate or skip. 
Add additional/different geometric shapes.
Add the ability to add multiple sequences with their own dedicated synth. 
Add more visuals using Three.js 

### Tools for Additional Features:
React Native? Probably not... 
Database (not sure what kind yet)
Three.js
